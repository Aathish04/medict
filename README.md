# Medict
Annual Class XII C.S Project

## What is it?
Medict, at its base level, takes data in CSV files and fills them into SQL databases. Further, it runs Machine Learning algorithms on the given data, and can predict the survival of new patients given their data, and can suggest medication for their recovery.

## How can I help?
Take a look at the Projects board for stuff that is currently in the works.
