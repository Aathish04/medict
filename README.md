# Medict
Medict is/was the Class 12 Project in Computer Science made by [Aathish Sivasubrahmanian](https://github.com/Aathish04), [Naveen M.K](https://github.com/naveen521kk), [Rajesh Kumar.S](https://github.com/hail-the-brave) and [Naresh.S](https://github.com/deadman9), Class of 2020-2021.

## A Brief Overview:
The main objective of this project is to provide an easy to use, feature-rich Patient Data Management System for hospital and clinic use in the form of a compact, simple and user-friendly software.
This software application maintains the data of the patients such as their age, symptoms, gender, temperature, medications given and mortality.
The application also stores all these data for future needs (such as predicting the patient’s life expectancy at the current level of care, or visualising the data graphically, both of which are also features of the application) and also lets the user enter new data while allowing them to tune the theme and font size of the software’s layout as they wish.
The product is intended for hospital or clinic administrators. Administrators, and those authorised by administrators are guaranteed access.

## Need For Computerisation:
The basic functioning of the majority of the hospitals in India is still manual. Not only is manual data management prone to error, it is also unnecessarily tedious. Software is preferred over manual management of data as it vastly simplifies the workflow of an administrator.
Data visualization is also much easier to accomplish with computers than by hand. At a glance and the press of a button, an administrator can easily have an intuitive view of every patient’s data.

## Tools Used:
1. Python
    1. PySimpleGUI
    2. Matplotlib
    3. Mysql.connector
    4. Numpy
2. SQL


## Application Benefits:
1. Data Entry is made easier.
2. Data modification is made easier.
3. Transfer of Data from file to Database is simpler.
4. Intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI)
5. Data Visualization tools (Graphs)
6. GUI Modification is possible and easy with settings.
7. GUI Theme and font size can be easily modified to suit the
user.
8. Persistent storage of user settings.

## Application Limits:
1. Requires an already existing SQL Database.
2. Only the pre-existing packaged CSV file can be used.
3. Backup and restore feature has not been implemented. 
4. Online Storage of Data has not been implemented.
5. Keyboard shortcuts have not been implemented.

## Future Possible Enhancements:

1. Allow for usage of custom CSV File.
2. Implementation of a “Backup and Restore” feature.
3. Implementation of Database to CSV data transmission.
4. Implementation of online/cloud storage of data.
5. Implementation of keyboard shortcuts.
6. Automatic theme changer based on Operating System preferences.
7. Automated Application Update System.
8. Input sanitisation and input validation.
