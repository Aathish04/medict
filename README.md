# Medict
Annual Class XII C.S Project

## What is it?
Medict, at its base level, is a hospital oriented patient management system for a particular illness.
Users will be able to submit patient data in the GUI provided, and the data is written to a CSV file that
holds all of this information. At the users request, the data can then be written to a MySQL database if
they so wish. As an additional feature, Medict will run Machine learning algorithms on the data to determine
the survival rate of any new patient, and can also suggest proper medication if required.

## How can I help?
Take a look at the Projects board for stuff that is currently in the works.
